This is an eagle cadsoft (Free version) of a 4 digit 7 segment display breakout board. 
The driver IC is the Maxim MAX7219CNG. This uses the through hole version because that 
is what I had on hand.

The ISET pot could be swapped out with a SMD resistor of about 9k ohms, using these parts.
See datasheet for calculations, never assume this will work with your components without verifying.

Use at your own risk.
