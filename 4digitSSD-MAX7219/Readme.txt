This is an eagle cadsoft (Free version) of a 4 digit 7 segment display breakout board. 
The driver IC is the Maxim MAX7219CNG. This uses the through hole version because that 
is what I had on hand.

The ISET pot could be swapped out with a SMD resistor of about 9k ohms, using these parts.

This is a 2 layer board, again, because I had two layer copper boards, and it made routing
easy and fast. A single layer board could be done, with time and patience. I may get to that
or maybe not. This is a busy work project while it is raining outside.

See datasheet for calculations, never assume this will work with your components without verifying.

Use at your own risk.
No warranty expressed or implied.

I hope you like it, and I am sorry if it isnt as professional as some of you could make it.
